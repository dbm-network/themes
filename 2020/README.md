### **How to use the Theme in *Discord Bot Maker***
1. Check firstly if you're using ^1.5.9 Discord Bot Maker, otherwise this theme won't work properly.
2. Go to the Discord Bot Maker folder, where you installed it.
*(default: C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Discord Bot Maker)*
3. A folder "themes" should exists, place the theme folder you downloaded in there. The files inside shouldn't be in an another folder.
4. If you haven't, close Discord Bot Maker and start it again. At the top under "Themes", it should appear now.

### **Edit Design**
**You don't like the theme-color and/or wan't to use *unused* design-ideas? That isn't a problem.**

There's a file inside the theme folder called "variables.css", inside it, there are the most used colors, and are easy to edit. *Use a color-picker, if you don't know how to get your desired color* and replace it with the already in-use colors, save it, and your desired colors will now be in use.
Now to the unused design ideas.
These are mostly "commented", means, inside of those "/*  */", if you remove those, save it, and the design ideas will now be in use.

### **Remove the Theme**
1. Firstly, go into Discord Bot Maker and select under "Themes", "Default", because when removing it, it may leave your Discord Bot Maker with issues.
2. Go back to the Discord Bot Maker themes folder.
*(default: C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Discord Bot Maker/themes)*
3. Delete the theme, or move it outside the Discord Bot Maker themes folder.
